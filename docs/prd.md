## Executive Summary

### Purpose

To enable library maintainers and enterprise teams to benchmark how well coding agents (e.g. Cursor) perform on library-specific tasks through local deployment and open source community collaboration.

**Library-specific tasks** include:
- Using library APIs correctly (proper imports, method calls, configuration)
- Following library-specific patterns and conventions
- Handling library-specific error cases and edge conditions
- Implementing common use cases as documented in library examples

### **Problem Statement**

**Core Problem:** Developers cannot predict how well coding agents handle their tools, libraries, and documentation, creating a critical gap in their quality assurance process. As AI-assisted development becomes mainstream, libraries that work poorly with coding agents face reduced adoption and increased support burden.

**Technical Barriers:**
- **Privacy and security barriers:** SaaS benchmarking solutions require uploading proprietary code and API keys to external services, creating insurmountable barriers for enterprise adoption and security-conscious teams.
- **No real-time IDE integration:** Existing benchmarking tools cannot integrate directly with local IDEs like Cursor, preventing real-time validation of coding agent performance during actual development workflows.
- **Library-specific blind spots:** General coding benchmarks miss the nuanced challenges of library-specific tasks, failing to identify when agents struggle with domain-specific APIs, patterns, and conventions.
- **Limited community expansion:** Closed-source solutions prevent the open source community from contributing library coverage, limiting benchmark scope to what individual teams can build alone.

### Target Audience

**Library Maintainers & Open Source Contributors:**
- Improve user adoption by ensuring your library works seamlessly with AI assistants
- Reduce support load by finding and fixing documentation gaps that confuse both humans and AIs
- Use benchmark results as a "State of AI-Readiness" report to guide documentation sprints

**Dev Tools & Enterprise Teams:**
- Benchmark agent performance on internal libraries and proprietary codebases without security risks
- Validate the ROI of different AI coding tools for your specific tech stack

### Solution Overview

OpenStackBench is an open source local deployment tool that allows users to clone any repository and automatically:

1. **Extracts** library-specific use cases from documentation and examples.
2. **Benchmarks** coding agents (starting with Cursor) on realistic library tasks.
3. **Analyzes** agent performance with detailed failure pattern analysis.
4. **Enables** community-driven expansion of benchmark coverage.
5. **Preserves** complete data ownership through local execution.

## Features

- **Repository Cloning & Analysis**
    
    Clone any GitHub repository and automatically extract library-specific use cases from documentation, README files, and example code.
    
- **IDE Agent Integration (Starting with Cursor)**
    
    Specialized workflows for benchmarking coding agents in IDE environments, starting with Cursor IDE integration for library-specific task evaluation.
    
- **Local Data Ownership**
    
    All benchmarking data, results, and analysis remain on local machines, eliminating privacy and security concerns for enterprise users.
    
- **Multi-Agent Support**
    
    Support both CLI agents (like Claude Code) for fully automated execution and IDE agents (like Cursor) that require manual execution workflows.
    
- **Community-Driven Expansion**
    
    Open source architecture enables community contributions to expand library coverage and benchmark sophistication.

## Analysis Report Information

### Report Generation
OpenStackBench generates dual output formats for each analysis:
- **results.json**: Structured data for programmatic access and integration
- **results.md**: Human-readable analysis report focusing on specific failure patterns and root causes

### Core Analysis Components

1. **Pass/Fail Flag**: Did coding agents successfully complete library-specific tasks?
2. **Success Rate**: Percentage of use cases completed successfully.
3. **Common Failures**: Top error patterns and failure reasons.

### Detailed Report Structure

1. **Executive Summary**
    - Pass/Fail status for the overall library evaluation
    - Success rate with specific numbers (e.g., 3/8 tasks successful = 37.5%)
    - Primary failure patterns identified (e.g., deprecated functions, outdated library versions)

2. **Specific Error Analysis**
    - Detailed breakdown of common failures like "object has no attribute" errors
    - API deprecation patterns with before/after code examples
    - Documentation inconsistencies that trip up coding agents

3. **Framework-Specific Insights**
    - API evolution timeline and breaking changes
    - Documentation quality assessment
    - Root cause analysis for systematic issues

### File Output Locations
- **Structured Data**: `./data/<uuid>/results.json`
- **Analysis Report**: `./data/<uuid>/results.md`
